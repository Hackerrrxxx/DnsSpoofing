Hashed Password Cracker
This project implements a simple tool for cracking hashed passwords using various hash algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256). The cracker uses techniques such as brute-force and dictionary-based attacks to recover the original password from its hashed value.

Key Features:

Supports multiple hash algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc.).
Implements both brute-force and dictionary-based cracking methods.
Option to use precomputed hash databases (rainbow tables) for faster cracking.
Includes a customizable wordlist for dictionary attacks.
Technologies Used:
Python (with libraries such as hashlib, time, and threading).
Customizable wordlist handling.
Disclaimer: This tool is for educational purposes only. It should not be used for illegal or unethical activities, such as cracking passwords without consent. Always ensure you have proper authorization when testing security systems.
